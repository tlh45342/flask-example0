# flask-example0

There is nothing exatoic about this "example" code.

As "flask" is demonstrated you will no doubt see exampples of it ran from the CLI.  This is an example for running it as an app.

## Flask example repoistories

Just to explain the repositries adn their puprose.  I wanted to keep the examples as seperate repositores - the better to summon up "just enough".

# flask-example0 - basic "text" book example
# flask-example1 - basic example using flask_login and sqlite.
# flask-example2 - basic example that uses "SSL"
# flask-example3 - basic example that uses SSL; flask_login; and sqlite
# flask-example4 - An FLASK example app that uses SSL; flask_login; sqlite and is a little prettier
